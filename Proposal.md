# Pokemon Rock, Paper, Scissors!

### Project Description and Motivation:
- We have decided to make a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; but with a theme of Pokemon.
- The thought process behind this was that we wanted to try and find something somewhat original to do, but not making it crushingly hard to make for ourselves.
- This will follow the same general rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (i.e. "This type beats that type"), but themed around Pokemon types (Water, Fire, Grass, etc.)
