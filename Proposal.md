# Pokemon Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Project Description and Motivation:
- We have decided to make a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; but with a theme of Pokemon.
- The thought process behind this was that we wanted to try and find something somewhat original to do, but not making it crushingly hard to make for ourselves.
- This will follow the same general rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (i.e. "This type beats that type"), but themed around Pokemon types (Water, Fire, Grass, etc.)

## Prior Art
There have been many other games like this, where someone takes Rock, Paper, Scissors, and adds their own twist/theme to it. We decided to go with Pokemon for our theme because it provides a simple type comparison system, much like Rock, Paper, Scissors, and it can easily be expanded to be more complex if we wanted.

## Core User Workflows
- User choices:
  - Program displays the different choices and matchups of the types to the user.
  - User chooses from the given choices.
- "Combat":
  - Opponent choice generation: At the beginning of each round of RPS, the AI will randomly choose a type from the list.
  - Match determination: Once both sides have chosen a type, the program will determine the winner of the match, and add the result to the score.
- End of Match/Rinse and Repeat:
  - Once the result is determined, the score is added to the scoreboard, and the match resets.
  - This loop keeps going until the user types quit.

## Day to Day Goals:
- By Monday, we will have the concept of our idea for our unit project.

- By Tuesday, Our first goal is to brainstorm how to evaluate which side wins the match (i.e the most efficient way to find out what type beats what type). We will at least show the different choices and matchups of the types to the user, and have the user choose a type from the list of types shown. We will be able to see if the user's choice is valid or not, and create a loop that asks the user for their choice again until they choose a valid type.

- By Wednesday, we should have a decent start of the combat portion of the program. Our AI should be able to randomly choose a type and the program will compare the two types to see which one wins the battle.

- By Thursday, we should have the program finished for the most part, and make sure that our program loops until the user types "quit". If we are ahead of schedule, we will attempt to integrate more type matchups into the program. At the end of the day, we should also have a plan of how we want to present it and a .README file ready.
