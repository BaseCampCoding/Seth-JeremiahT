# Pokemon Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Project Description and Motivation:
- We have decided to make a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; but with a theme of Pokemon.
- The thought process behind this was that we wanted to try and find something somewhat original to do, but not making it crushingly hard to make for ourselves.
- This will follow the same general rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (i.e. "This type beats that type"), but themed around Pokemon types (Water, Fire, Grass, etc.)

## Prior Art
There have been many other games like this, where someone takes Rock, Paper, Scissors, and adds their own twist/theme to it. We decided to go with Pokemon for our theme because it provides a simple type comparison system, much like Rock, Paper, Scissors, and it can easily be expanded to be more complex if we wanted.

## Core User Workflows
- User choices:
  - Program displays the different choices and matchups of the types to the user.
  - User chooses from the given choices.
- "Combat":
  - Opponent choice generation: At the beginning of each round of RPS, the AI will randomly choose a type from the list.
  - Match determination: Once both sides have chosen a type, the program will determine the winner of the match, and add the result to the score.
- End of Match/Rinse and Repeat:
  - Once the result is determined, the score is added to the scoreboard, and the match resets.
  - This loop keeps going until the user types quit.

## Day to Day Goals:
- By Monday, we will have the concept of our idea for our unit project.

- By Tuesday, Our first goal is to brainstorm how we want to set up the program by applying a list of the types. The most efficient way to find out what type beats what type. We will at least show the different choices and matchups of the types to the user, and have the user choose from the list of types shown. We will working on functions for the user inputs and seeing if the choice is valid toward our concept. Also, include these functions into loops that we will start working on Wednesday.

- By Wednesday, we will have loops for the functions that we created on Tuesday. If we are done with the basic concept by the first half of Wednesday, we will start working on expanding the list of types. 

- By Thursday, we will start working with the multiple types and how they are used against other types and cleaning up to be ready to present on Friday.

- By Friday, we will completed our program's code and will set up a step by step process to showing how the code runs.
