# Pokemon Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Project Description and Motivation:
- We have decided to make a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors; but with a theme of Pokemon.
- The thought process behind this was that we wanted to try and find something somewhat original to do, but not making it crushingly hard to make for ourselves.
- This will follow the same general rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors (i.e. "This type beats that type"), but themed around Pokemon types (Water, Fire, Grass, etc.)

## Prior Art
There have been many other games like this, where someone takes Rock, Paper, Scissors, and adds their own twist/theme to it. We decided to go with Pokemon for our theme because it provides a simple type comparison system, much like Rock, Paper, Scissors, and it can easily be expanded to be more complex if we wanted.
